Javascript Challenge

**Version 1.4.0**

**Calender App challenge activity.**

The aim of this project is to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

This project focuses on the use of javascript to create this application.

Other than creating a user friendly app, this project required the use of certain technologies. Using these technologies also ensured that the user has an enjoyable experience, as well as showcases my skills and knowledge gained through this program.

## About the Project 

As I proceed in my career as a web developer, I will probably be asked to complete a coding assessment. These assessments are typically a combination of challenging and interactive challenges. As a bootcamp student, I want to build a calender app that users can use to create events and ultimately save those event, retrieve them later, and possibly edit previous stored events

Initial design of the app has the following deliverables:

When the user opens the app, the current day is displayed at the top of the calender.

They are able to scroll and add events to any blocks at any given hour.

The calender shows a color coded time block to indicate the time frame of each events.

Most importantly, users may be able to save their events which will be stored to local storage and easily retrieved.


## Minimun Requirements

Functional, deployed application.

GitHub repository with README describing project.

Images showing completed portions of the app.

After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.
